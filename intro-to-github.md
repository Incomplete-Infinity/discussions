# Welcome to __Incomplete Infinity__ GitHub Repository

### Introduction To GitHub

Embark on a comprehensive, visually enriched journey through __Incomplete Infinity__ GitHub Repository, where the symphony of code unfolds in a celestial rhythm.

#### 1. Visual Overview

Behold the expansive git graph, a celestial roadmap mapping commits in the vast 'main' branch. Each commit, akin to a star in our coding constellation, bears a unique tag.

```mermaid
gitGraph
   commit
```

As developers 'push' code, new stars emerge, coalescing into a constellation of progress.

```mermaid
gitGraph
        commit
        commit
```

The 'main' branch, a sanctuary safeguarded for security, beckons contributions through 'forks' and 'branches.'

```mermaid
gitGraph
        commit
        commit
        branch AwesomeFeature
        checkout AwesomeFeature
```

'Checkout' your branch, carving your distinct niche in the expansive GitHub galaxy.

```mermaid
gitGraph
        commit
        commit
        branch AwesomeFeature
        checkout AwesomeFeature
        commit
```

Commit freely to your branch, weaving an intricate tale of code adventures.

```mermaid
    gitGraph
        commit
        commit
        branch AwesomeFeature
        checkout AwesomeFeature
        commit
        commit
        commit
```

Conclude your coding saga with a 'pull request,' extending an invitation to collaborators.

```mermaid
gitGraph
        checkout main
        commit
        commit
        branch AwesomeFeature
        commit
        commit
        commit
        checkout main
	    merge AwesomeFeature id:"pull request"
```

Encounter conflicts as stars align, harmoniously resolved through the 'merge' ritual.

```mermaid
gitGraph
        checkout main
        commit
        commit
        branch AwesomeFeature
        commit
        commit
        commit
        checkout main
        branch FeatureA
	    checkout FeatureA
        commit
        checkout main
        merge AwesomeFeature
        merge FeatureA
```

Fear not! Each feature claims its cosmic space, coexisting harmoniously.

```mermaid
gitGraph
        checkout main
        commit
        commit
        branch AwesomeFeature
        checkout AwesomeFeature
		commit
		branch Helper
		checkout main
		commit id:"Breaking Changes"
		checkout AwesomeFeature
		merge main
		checkout Helper
		merge main
	    checkout AwesomeFeature
	    merge Helper id:"pull request"
		checkout main
        merge AwesomeFeature
```

In cosmic collaborations, helpers forge new galaxies, merging seamlessly.

Unveil the powers GitHub bestows upon you:

1. `Clone`: Download the essence of a project.
  - Makes your very own copy of a project
2. `Branch`: Create alternate dimensions for experiments.
  - 
3. `Push`: Upload your cosmic creations.
4. `Pull Request`: Seek approval to merge into the main universe.

### 3. Clone a Repository

Embark on your coding odyssey by cloning a repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/organization/repository.git
```

A local copy for your coding experiments!

### 4. Create a Branch

Forge new dimensions for coding adventures:

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```

Isolate features without disturbing the coding cosmos.

### 5. Make Changes and Commit

Craft your coding tale:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix issue #123: Add feature XYZ"
```

Clear commit messages guide others through your coding journey.

### 6. Push Changes to GitHub

Broadcast your coding tale:

```bash
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

Make your contributions visible across the GitHub galaxy.

### 7. Create a Pull Request

Initiate discussions with cosmic peers:

Create a pull request for your changes on GitHub.

### 8. Review and Merge

Engage in cosmic collaboration:

Wait for review, make adjustments, and once approved, merge your changes.

Reviews ensure code quality before merging into the cosmic main branch.

#### 9. Checking a Repo for Deployment

Navigate the GitHub stars:

##### Deployments Tab

1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. Visit the "Deployments" tab.

Crucial for ensuring successful cosmic deployments.

##### Deployment Status

Read the cosmic signs:

Review the status and logs for a harmonious deployment.

Understanding deployment status ensures a smooth cosmic journey.

#### 10. Additional Resources

Embark on a deeper exploration of the GitHub galaxy:
